# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

-	During this analysis over 90,000 employees are projected to retire.
-	Two very valuable positions (Senior Engineer & Senior Staff) have the most retirements coming up.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

Overall, the analysis required was multi-part. Initial information suggests that the impacts, in terms of numbers of roles/positions to be filled as a result of the silver tsunami, are very impactful. The count of employees expected to retire totals 90,398 at Pewlett-Hackard. Planning for the future is needed. As we continue to plan, we can think about the future and grow new talent within the organization. Mentoring programs for the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees would benefit everyone.


### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
90,398 roles are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time. The table below provides a breakdown by department.




### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
No, we have 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
As we can see in the table below, there are not enough qualified employees for the mentorship program. With the low numbers of qualified mentors, the mentors would be stretched thin, considerably.
